# pretty-plots

In my projects, I have to plot lots of embeddings, and it happens that I keep reusing my plotting functions from a project to a project. Finally, I decided to make it more structured and created a mini-library mainly for myself, but maybe it could be useful for someone else too.

Dependencies you will need:

- python 
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- pandas
- adjust_text


These functions are mostly wrappers around seaborn functions, but it is quite convenient to me not to adjust them every time and produce plots ready to put into a manuscript or a presentation.
